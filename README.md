### Notes

- The default numerical solver is RK4. This isn't changable through the UI because we believe it's the best one to use. 
  If you want to switch numerical solvers, navigate to the following file in the source code:
  BingBoysGolf/core/src/com/project_1_2/group16/screens/GameScreen.java
  and change the numerical solver on line 93 to either RK2 or EULER.

- Gradle instructions:
  - make sure you have gradle installed: https://gradle.org/
  - open a terminal and navigate to this repository
  - to run the game, type "gradle run" in the terminal (starting up might take a while)

- Java Runtime Environment must be needed to run the game (minimum 16).
